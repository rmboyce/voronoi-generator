# Voronoi Diagram Generator
Generates Voronoi diagrams (diagrams where each point in a colored region is closer to the region's "seed point" than any other seed point) and the Delaunay triangulation (a triangulation where the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points in the triangulation).

See details and a demo at my website [here](https://www.ramseyboyce.com/javascript_demos/voronoi_generator/voronoi_generator.html).
