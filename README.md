# voronoi-generator
Generates voronoi diagrams (diagrams where each point in a colored region is closer to the region's "seed point" than any other seed point) and the delaunay triangulation (a triangulation where the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points in the triangulation). More information: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).  
Use V to toggle voronoi diagrams vs delaunay triangulation, F to toggle fast/slow voronoi algorithms, C to toggle circumcircles, and N to toggle random point movement.
